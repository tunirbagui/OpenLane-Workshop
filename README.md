# Advanced-Physical-Design-Workshop-Using-OpenLane-Sky130
#This repository contains all the information included in the Advanced Physics Design Using OpenLANE / Sky 130 workshop. This workshop helped me in learning ASIC implementation steps from RTL to GDSII flow using open source EDA tools and Google – Skywater technology PDK. Google – Skywater130 PDK is the first manufacturable 130nm opensource PKD
